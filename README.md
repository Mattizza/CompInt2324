# Computational Intelligence 2023/2024

Repository for the Computational Intelligence course taught by [Giovanni Squillero](https://github.com/squillero) during the A.A. 2023/2024. Regarding the Labs and the assignments, me and [Claudio Savelli](https://github.com/ClaudioSavelli) have been working together for [Lab 1](https://github.com/Mattizza/CompInt2324/tree/main/Lab_1) and the [Halloween Challenge](https://github.com/Mattizza/CompInt2324/tree/main/Halloween_Challenge). For the rest, I have tried to develop and implement what I believe to be the most efficient solutions for the problem at hand. If not explicitly stated, **I did not take ispiration by any other repository and/or colleague (neither for the design of this README.md, whose copies make me feel like an influencer 🤦🏻‍♂💅)**.

Since I'm loving the rationale behind evolution, I have also included some extra mini-projects in which some EAs have been applied to real (but not only) problems. Just give it a look.

Finally, I hope you enjoy the contents as much as I did while creating them! 🤗

### Disclaimer

Even though most of the code presented in this repo has been produced by me or in general by the authors, or sometimes by the Professor during lectures, some pieces have been eventually developed through the help provided by several discussions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and by AI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (version 3.5). These have represented a great starting point for creating our own custom solutions!
