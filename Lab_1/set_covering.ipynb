    "An implementation of the A* search algorithm ideated and programmed by **Claudio Savelli (s)** & **Mattia Sabato (s305849)** during a cold and rainy October. We have designed the algorithm in order to not only reach the goal in the **fastest way** but also in a **smart way**. We achieve this by reducing the number of overlappings and by forcing a solution which has the less number of shared points in the sets considered."
