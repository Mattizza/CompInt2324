# Computational Intelligence 2023/2024

Repository for the Computational Intelligence course taught by [Giovanni Squillero](https://github.com/squillero) during the A.A. 2023/2024. Regarding the Labs and the assignments, me and [Claudio Savelli](https://github.com/ClaudioSavelli) have been working together to develop and implement what we believe to be the most efficient solutions for the problem at hand. Hope you enjoy the contents as much as we did while creating them! ü§ó
