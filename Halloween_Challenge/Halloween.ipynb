    "# Halloween Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge proposed during the 2023/2024 edition of the course. We are in the realm of *SET COVERING*, an NP-hard problem for which we are requested to find the **best solution** with the **fewest calls** to the fitness functions for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `num_points = [100, 1_000, 5_000]`\n",
    "* `num_sets = num_points`\n",
    "* `density = [.3, .7]` \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem has been settled so to have the **same pool of candidate sets** for each participant; in this way, it is possible to easily make a comparison between different solutions! We are glad to introduce an original algorithm which we designed in order to achieve several goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get a solution **close to the best** possible;\n",
    "* Keep the number of calls to the fitness function **low**;\n",
    "* Avoid a huge amount of computations and design a **very fast** algorithm;\n",
    "* *Put ourselves in a **realistic scenario** where we don't necessarily have the amount of knowledge we were given in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*By shifting many of the computations inside the fitness function, one would be able to greatly reduce the number of calls. This happens because we are simply moving all the computational burden inside the function, which instead should only evaluate the current and the candidate state. In order to keep our solution as fair and realistic as possible (and, so, to not exploit tricks to solve the problem in 3 steps, quite unrealistic isn't it?) we decided to use the most simple evaluation function, i.e. the one proposed by the Professor. Moreover, we also kept the most basic tweak function and we strongly avoided the need for extensive calculations during the search for the solution. We believe that, given the particular structure of the problem, finding a perfect solution would be easy; we don't like easy or pre-made things, so we designed from scratch a new algorithm to find the best trade-off between number of calls and goodness of the solution. Finally, even though stochastic, our algorithm, if tuned adequately, has a quite low variance; this is very important since, thanks to the high speed at which it runs, several iterations can be done until the best possible solution is found."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the effectiveness of our solution, we have defined a baseline and a benchmark. The first is our lower bound, i.e. the performance we would get when considering a simple random tweaking; the idea is to not perform worse than this! The second is our upper bound, and it is what we would like to approach as much as possible with our solution; in order to have a very nice approximation of the optimum, we computed the solution using the steepest ascent algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all the tests we use the following counters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `count_fitness`: the number of times `fitness` is called;\n",
    "* `count_updates`: the number of updates of the current solution;\n",
    "* `missing_steps`: the number of steps with no improvements before stopping the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We always initialize `count_fitness = 1`, so to keep into account the first evaluation of the algorithm, and then we increase it by 1 for each comparison. However, in the following notebook you will usually find `fitness(new_state) > fitness(current_state)`, so should not we increase it by 2? Actually, since in this specific case the evaluation of `fitness` is not computationally expensive, we lazily avoid to store each time its result in a dedicated variable and simply recompute it each time. Even though wrong (at a code level) in a general case, it actually causes no problems in this specific situation (at a latency level), so we decided to keep it here and increment the counter just by 1 (at a conceptual level).\n",
    "\n",
    "For what does it concerns `count_updates`, it represents the number of times we find a solution better than the actual one. It actually does not cover a paramount importance, but it is always nice to keep track of these additional statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when `missing_steps` reaches a pre-defined treshold, the algorithm stops and returns the actual solution. This is done so to avoid running (and evaluating) for number of times always equal to the number of steps."
